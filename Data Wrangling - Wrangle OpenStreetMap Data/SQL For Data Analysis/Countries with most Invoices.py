##  Alright, now that you're warmed up let's get down to business!

##  In this problem set we'll pretend the Chinook database is the data for your own personal music shop!
##  We'll be marketing your shop and hosting Music Festival using answers we get from 
##  the data stored in your database.
##  Let's get started :)

##  First, you'd like to run a promotion targeting the 3 countries with the 
##  highest number of invoices.  

##  Write a query that returns the 3 countries with the highest number of invoices, along with the number ##  of invoices for these countries.


QUERY ='''
SELECT BillingCountry, count(*) as totalInvoices
  FROM Invoice
 GROUP BY BillingCountry
 ORDER BY totalInvoices DESC
 LIMIT 3;
